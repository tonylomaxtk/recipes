# Recipes

TK recipes exercise

## To Start

- Navigate to root of project and run:
  `docker compose up --build`
- This will create new images and run new containers based on those images.

## Things I would add if this was real/I had more time

- Proper optimistic update rather than the slightly hacky version I built.
- Tests on the FE. Not a hard requirement but would be nice.

## Review

- I'm aware this is pretty hacky so feel free to tear it apart. Especially the backend as I've never worked in Python/Django before.
